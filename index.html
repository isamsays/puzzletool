  <h2>Why Accurate Puzzle Input Matters</h2>
<p>A Puzzle Tool relies on the information you provide. If your puzzle input is inaccurate, the solver's recommendations may not align with your actual game situation. Here's why precision is crucial:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ensures Valid Solutions:</strong> Accurate input allows the tool to analyze the exact board state and suggest appropriate moves.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Saves Time:</strong> Avoids the need to redo entries or troubleshoot incorrect solutions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Boosts Learning:</strong> Provides reliable feedback for strategy improvement.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Inputting Puzzles</h2>
<h2>1. Choose Your Input Method</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Screenshot Upload:</strong> Most Puzzle Tools allow you to upload a screenshot of your current game board. This is quick and leverages AI for automatic recognition.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Manual Grid Input:</strong> If a screenshot isn't clear or you want to customize your puzzle, use the manual input option to recreate the board block by block.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Ensure Clarity and Completeness</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>For Screenshots:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Capture the entire game grid and all available pieces.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Use high-resolution images to ensure every block is visible.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Avoid overlays like ads or notifications that may obscure the board.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>For Manual Input:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Carefully match the board layout, placing each block in its correct position.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Input all available pieces, including their shapes and orientations.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Double-Check Before Submitting</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Review your input for missing or misplaced blocks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Confirm that all available pieces are entered.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make adjustments if necessary before clicking "Solve."</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Move Rationales:</strong> Some tools explain why a move is optimal, helping you learn the underlying strategy.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Evaluate Multiple Options</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Don't just follow the first suggestion blindly.</p>
  </li>

    <p>Explore alternative moves if the tool provides them-this can reveal creative strategies and improve your decision-making.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

  </li>
</ul>
